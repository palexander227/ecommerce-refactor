## Functionality

Redux is used to manage the state of a React app. For example, what we need for this app to render the user interface correctly,  is the products in the shopping cart. This is an instance of "state". This app makes use of Redux to manage global state. It is an industry standard for complex state management in large-scale React apps. Another way of managing global state is through the use of React's Context API; this has been gaining popularity in the last couple years.
